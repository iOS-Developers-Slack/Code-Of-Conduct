*This policy is a "living" document, and subject to refinement and expansion in the future.*

### The **iOS Developers Slack** should be a safe place for everybody regardless of

- gender, gender identity or gender expression 
- sexual orientation
- disability
- physical appearance (including but not limited to body size)
- race
- age
- religion

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.


### As someone who is part of this Slack, you agree that:

- We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusivity.
- We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment, or discrimination.
- We respect people’s boundaries and identities.
- We refrain from using language or imagery that can be considered oppressive (systemically or otherwise), eg. sexualizing, sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, classist, etc. - this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs.
We avoid using offensive topics as a form of humor.

### We actively work towards:

- Being a safe community.
- Cultivating a network of support & encouragement for each other.
- Encouraging responsible and varied forms of expression.

### We condemn:

- Stalking, doxxing, or publishing private information.
- Threats of harm, harassment.
- Anything that compromises people’s safety.
- Personal attacks.

**These things are NOT OK.**

### Expected Behavior

This community thrives because of everyone's contributions. We exchange ideas, ask questions, answer some of them, have debates, or sometimes are here just to hang out. There are times where the nature of a question may seem simple, has been asked and answered, or may trigger some personal feelings. It may make you feel like a snide or hurtful remark is justified, but it isn't. If you do not have a thoughtful or helpful comment, please refrain from leaving a comment.

Please do not characterize questions others ask as stupid or simple; all questions are welcome. Please do not call out members for the tools they choose to use or decisions they make.

Futile or petty debates about the code of conduct are highly discouraged. This doesn't mean you cannot raise concerns or issues, but please be considerate and constructive, rather than heated and destructive with your commentary.

A simple way to remember how you're expected to act: if you can't find anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.

### If you say something that is found offensive, and you are called out on it, let’s:

- Listen without interruption.
- Believe what the person is saying & do not attempt to disqualify what they have to say.
- Ask for tips / help with avoiding making the offense in the future.
- Apologize and ask forgiveness.

### Infractions

Failing to follow the community guidelines as described in this document carries consequences. 

**For minor infractions, you may:**
- Be temporarily suspended from the Slack.
- Have your invitation privileges temporarily revoked.

**For more serious offenses, repeat offenses, or situations where you are not believed to be acting in good faith, you may:**
- Be asked to leave permanently.
- Have your invitation privileges permanently revoked.

**For all infractions:**

- Penalties will be determined by the admins. The actions taken will result from a discussion, which you may be a part of, and the consequences will be binding.
- While infractions are being discussed, the involved users will lose their invitation privileges to ensure if they are found to have violated rules, that no new users will be added to the community on their behalf.

#### Privacy
- All conversations are private unless otherwise specified. 
  - The only exceptions to this rule pertain to the enforcement of our code of conduct. A conversation may be shared with any member of the administrative team when a violation of the code of conduct has occurred. The conversation may then be reviewed by the entire administrative team, if necessary, to determine an appropriate resolution.

- If you wish to share a conversation, or part of one, you must get permission from each person involved.

### Best Practices
- Stay on topic. The goal of the iOS Folks Slack is to facilitate discussion of things relating to development on and for Apple platforms. This includes but is not limited to iOS and macOS, watchOS, tvOS, but also related tools like the Swift compiler, Swift on Linux, and other tools in the Apple ecosystem. We have room for discussing many development adjacent topics as well, such as marketing, business, server-side programming, or other things that may be important to a developer working on Apple platforms.
- Communities thrive when everyone contributes in ways beyond promoting themselves or their work. If you are a contributing member of the Slack, you are welcome to share and promote work you're excited to have done or job opportunities you may have, but this Slack is not purely a marketing channel. If your only posts are ones promoting your own work or jobs, we will delete them and ask you to stop.
- If you’re reaching out to someone for the first time, be polite, ask if they are ok with you messaging them, and be upfront with what your reason for messaging them is. Please apply the same level of respect you would in a public conversation, knowing that private conversations are held to the same standard. Please do not send unsolicited marketing or recruitment direct messages, especially if you’ve never engaged with someone before, unless the person has indicated that they want to receive those kinds of messages in a public channel, like #job-board.
- If you have a technical question, please try and figure it out before posting here. If you're having trouble, all questions are welcome.

### Invitations

#### Requirements
- You must be a member for one month before you are allowed to request an invitation for another person.
  - At the discretion of the admins, if you are actively participating in the community and have not been a member for a month, you may be allowed to request invites sooner than one month.
- You must be a member currently in good standing in the community.

#### Who to invite

- Please invite people **you know and are willing to vouch for**. The people you invite are your responsibility.
- A good rule of thumb is to invite people you've worked with, collaborated with, or know personally.
- They must be a developer working in the Apple ecosystem, or learning skills related to developing on or for one of those platforms. Skill level or experience don't matter, as long as they're genuinely trying to learn how to program for Apple platforms.
- Do not invite strangers or people you've just met.

#### Policies
- **You can invite up to 2 people per calendar month.**
- **A maximum of 4 people from the same organization can be invited per month.**
- Since one of the goals of this Slack and these changes is to create an inclusive space for [underrepresented groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underrepresented_group#Underrepresented_groups_in_STEM) in tech, **inviting an underrepresented member of the community will allow you an extra invite in the following month**.
- You are responsible for those who you invite... If you invite someone who is causing issues, your future invitation requests may not be honored.
- Use the workflow in the **#please-add** channel to invite people you would like to have join the Slack.

**Please avoid inviting people in a public internet setting such as tweeting about it**. This often leads to random people who come across the conversation asking for requests as well, which creates an uncomfortable situation for those involved.
