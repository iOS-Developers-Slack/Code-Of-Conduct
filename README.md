*This policy is a "living" document, and subject to refinement and expansion in the future.*

### The **iOS Developers Slack** should be a safe place for everybody regardless of

- gender, gender identity or gender expression 
- sexual orientation
- disability
- physical appearance (including but not limited to body size)
- race
- age
- religion

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.


### As someone who is part of this Slack, you agree that:

- We are collectively and individually committed to safety and inclusivity.
- We have zero tolerance for abuse, harassment, or discrimination.
- We respect people’s boundaries and identities.
- We refrain from using language that can be considered oppressive (systemically or otherwise), eg. sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, classist, etc. - this includes (but is not limited to) various slurs.
We avoid using offensive topics as a form of humor.

### We actively work towards:

- Being a safe community.
- Cultivating a network of support & encouragement for each other.
- Encouraging responsible and varied forms of expression.

### We condemn:

- Stalking, doxxing, or publishing private information.
- Threats of harm, harassment.
- Anything that compromises people’s safety.
- Personal attacks.

**These things are NOT OK.**

### If you say something that is found offensive, and you are called out on it, let’s:

- Listen without interruption.
- Believe what the person is saying & do not attempt to disqualify what they have to say.
- Ask for tips / help with avoiding making the offense in the future.
- Apologize and ask forgiveness.

Failing to follow the community guidelines as described in this document carries consequences. For minor infractions, you may be temporarily suspended from the Slack. Upon repeat offenses, or if the community believes you are not acting in good faith, you may be asked to leave permanently.

#### Privacy
- All conversations are private unless otherwise specified. 
- If you wish to share a conversation, or part of one, you must get permission from each person involved.

### Best Practices
- Stay on topic. The goal of the iOS Slack is to facilitate discussion of things relating to iOS development. This could be about marketing, business, server-side programming, or other things that may be important to an iOS developer.
- If you have a technical question, please try and figure it out before posting here. If you're having trouble, all questions are welcome.

### Invitations

- You must be a member for one week before you are allowed to invite another person.
- Try to limit your invites to 1 per week, unless you feel rather strongly about a few people.
- You are responsible for those who you invite... If you invite someone who is causing issues, then your invitation privileges may be revoked.

**If you experience or notice abuse, harassment, discrimination, or feel unsafe, let an admin know. Here is a list of the current moderators and their Slack IDs:**

**Helpful tips for new people joining us.**
* Use @channel and @everybody sparingly. Everyone in the Slack, across every time zone gets a notification when you use those keywords.
* If you have something to share, try to find the appropriate channel to put it in.
* Introduce yourself in #introductions. We don't all know each other.
